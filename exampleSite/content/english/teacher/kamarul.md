### About Me {.tabset}

I like to analyze data to answer research questions and test hypotheses. Currently I investigate questions related to Tuberculosis (TB) through my work as a Statistical Research Member at the Faculty of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, [UiTM Kedah](https://kedah.uitm.edu.my/v1/faculties-a-academic-centres/computer-a-mathematical-sciences).  

I graduated from the [University of Kentucky](https://math.as.uky.edu/) with a BSc in Mathematics in 1992. In 2010 I began working toward my MSc in Decision Sciences as a part-time student at [Universiti Utara Malaysia](http://www.sqs.uum.edu.my/index.php/en/), under the School of Quantitative Sciences, College of Art and Sciences (CAS), where I did my partial thesis paper in Structural Eqauation Modeling (SEM) under the advisement of [Assoc. Prof. Dr. Zahayu Md Yusof](http://expertise.uum.edu.my/DOE/doe_view.aspx?ad_doe=zahayu). I graduated from UUM at the end of 2012.  

I am a beginner in R and being an active member of [Malaysian R User Public Group](https://www.meetup.com/Malaysia-R-User-Group/).
