## ABOUT OUR JOURNEY

Welcome to the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Faculty of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, UiTM Kedah Branch Campus. We offer service courses in Mathematics and Statistics to all the faculties at UiTM Kedah. We started with the Department of Quantitative Sciences and in 2007 it has gone through a rebranding process and is now called the Department of Mathematical Sciences. Currently, the Department of Mathematical Sciences consists of 20 lecturers (10 Mathematics, 9 Statistics, and 1 Physics).
